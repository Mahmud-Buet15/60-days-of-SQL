### QUERIES:
1.	Write a query that prints a list of employee names (i.e.: the name attribute) from the Employee table in alphabetical order.
2.	Write a query that prints a list of employee names (i.e.: the name attribute) for employees in Employee having a salary greater than $2000 per month who have been employees for less than 10 months. Sort your result by ascending employee_id.
4.	Find the number of most Senior Employees.
5.	We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly salary x months worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as 2 space-separated integers.
